### Embracing the Learning Journey in Tech

**Description:** Navigating the vast landscape of a tech degree can feel overwhelming. This article shares insights and advice for tech students to embrace diversified experiences and opportunities, ultimately leading to a fulfilling career.

As I approach graduation, I often find myself reflecting on how much more there is to learn. Is it bad to feel this way? Absolutely not. A rational person acknowledges the endless ocean of information available in a tech degree, but the key is to be wise and not let it overwhelm you.

One honest piece of advice I have, which I also shared with my younger brother who is about to start a computer science degree, is to seek as much diversified experience as possible during your university years. What does this mean? Like any field, technology and computer science encompass a wide variety of areas. You might find that your initial classes aren't where your true interests lie, and that's okay. Diversification is crucial. 

In your early jobs and internships, employers will ask if you have experience with certain languages and technologies. They don't expect you to be an expert in any of them, but having some familiarity can open many doors. Always be honest about your level of expertise and your willingness to learn.

My journey included an internship at a Big Tech company during my first summer at university. Although I didn't receive a return offer, I gained valuable insights. I now admit,  wasn't particularly motivated or ready, especially with the challenges of a remote internship due to COVID-19. I decided to gain more experience by working at startups in my hometown, where I had more responsibilities than I would have at a large company. This experience came at the cost of free time and a low pay, but it boosted my confidence.

Before my final semester, I had an offer from another Big Tech company but turned it down. Why? Instead, I chose to spend a year abroad in Italy, where I learned iOS development at an academy in Naples. This experience ignited my passion for iOS development and UI/UX design. I even won the WWDC Swift Student Challenge during this time.

After all these experiences, I am still just a person trying to figure out my next steps. However, I now see my degree as a gateway to numerous exciting opportunities. My advice is to stop worrying about being too late or too early for something. If it’s on your mind, give it a try. You think it’s too early to start applying to internships? Still do it. Too late? Do it too. Too early for looking for a job? Try. The impostor syndrome can come and go, and the time is going to pass anyways so just thrive on curiosity and enjoy the process.
