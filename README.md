Before I dove into Computer Science (dubbed the career of the future) at one of Mexico's top universities, I wish I'd had access to real stories from students who'd been there. As I stood at the crossroads of this life-changing decision, firsthand accounts would have been invaluable. Now, as a graduate, I can confidently say it was the right path for me.
